        <h1>Good web design is</h1>
        <h2>Simple</h2>
        <p>Keep it simple stupid. The mother of all design principles still applies to the web.</p>
        <h2>Familiar</h2>
        <p>The web is built on patterns. Rely on familiarity and avoid breaking expectations.</p>
        <h2>Tested</h2>
        <p>Data is a powerful tool, but just like any tool, it can be abused. Gather and utilize qualitative and quantitative data and constantly strive to improve processes.</p>
        <h2>Iterative</h2>
        <p>The web is an ever-evolving platform, and web design is never finished.</p>
        <h2>Unobtrusive</h2>
        <p>The web is about information. Make it easy to find and stay out of the way.</p>
        <h2>Fast</h2>
        <p>The web thrives on the speed of information. Make things faster not slower.</p>
        <h2>As little design as possible</h2>
        <p>And as little code as possible.</p>
